                <p>A website down when offering the consultancy services create anxiety to our customers rendering poor services, hence there is a need to provide full maintenance support apart from its application to provide better functionality and continuity of our service. Buggy apps are a nuisance to business and as a company, we have adopted a well effective bug tracking system by coming up with models of its kind.</p>
